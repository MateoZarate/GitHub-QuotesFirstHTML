This includes all parents and family as well. Ages 4 and under get in free. The wristband does NOT get students into the basketball game on Friday. They may use their Student ID if they have the ACT card to receive ONE ticket prior to the game or pay $4 for a student ticket-$6 for adults. Every person (including adults) must have a ticket to enter the game, so please pay attention to when/where they will go on sale. Tickets for the game will be pre-sold during the week and will SELL OUT! You CANNOT show up to the Main Gym Saturday without a ticket. NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED A TICKET!</center></h4>
